    "Note 2: You might wanter why the TESS observation does not count as the detection. The problem has to do with data transfer, which is usually limited for a satellite orbiting far away and with strict reqiurements on power consumption. So the TESS telescope did observe the field of the SN first, but this data was not analyzed until far later, _after_ it had also been detected by ZTF."
